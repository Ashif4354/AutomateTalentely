# If you run any other application while the test is in progress, warnings will come, SO DO AT YOUR OWN RISK
# However warnings have been handled (i.e. the test will continue, but wanings may occur)

# This application only attends tests assigned by training cell
# This applicaiotn does choose correct answers according to the requirements specified by the user
# Some test might not open and throws error, These have been handled too

# All the answers has been taken from Talentely portal only.
# It has been noted that some of the answers in the talentely portal itself is wrong , so these questions will not be answered correctly. sorry for inconvenience
# Frequency of these wrong answers is less than 1%, So no need to worry

# This application does not have answers to c programming questions 
# So it will not attend c programming tests
# However you can choose to make the application attend the c programming test without the application typing the code
# After opening the application choose option 6 to enable the application to attend c programming tests(without answers)
# You can do it manually too, open 'Student.json' with a text editor, and set the value of 'attend-c-test' to true or false respectively
# How ever in future versions , A solution for this problem can be introduced

# Enter email and password correctly
# If you enter wrong email or password, just choose option 3 after opening the aplication and edit your details

# The test progress denotes  the tests completed by the application not the user
# Dont select reset progress option unless you want to reset progress
# The Progress does not reset itself.
# If the progress is reset, all the test will be performed from first by the application

# If you close the application or the browser window at any time, dont worry, the application can continue from the same point (i.e. same test). progress will not reset.
# If at any time the application closes by itself just run application again

# You can specify how much percentage of questions need to be answered correctly 
# Just select option 4 when you open the application, and enter the percentage
# The number of correctly answered question according to the percentage give by user can vary because Talentely portal is shit

# You can specify how much time to attend each test in percentage
# Just select option 5 when you open the application, and enter the percentage
# The time attended for each test may vary by 1 minute, regardless the user mentions percentage or not
# If you are choosing to set time percentage, its best to set a value more than 60%, but its upto you. (The default is 100%)
# The training cell demands minimum 50% test time
