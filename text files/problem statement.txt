Features and Functionalities:

    User Registration and Information Collection:
    The ATS application will allow users to register by collecting their usernames and passwords. Additionally, the application will gather user-provided information such as the percentage of correct answers and percentage completion time for tests.

    Local User Profile Management:
    ATS will enable users to create and manage profiles by saving their information locally, ensuring convenient access to past performance data.

    Selective Test Participation:
    The application will empower users to manually choose which tests they wish to attend. This feature offers flexibility and personalized test-taking experiences.

    ATS will include a manual option for users to reset their test progress, allowing them to start anew when needed.

    Seamless Talentely Portal Integration:
    The application will have the capability to open a web browser and navigate to the Talentely portal's login page.

    Automated Test Login:
    ATS will streamline the login process by automatically signing in to the Talentely portal using the user-provided credentials.

    Efficient Test Navigation:
    Once logged in, ATS will navigate to each test, utilizing the information stored to automatically ferch test duration and question count.

    Test Progress Monitoring:
    ATS can display the test status and progress, giving users feedback on their progress.

    Dynamic Answering Strategy:
    ATS will incorporate a dynamic answering strategy, allowing users to specify a percentage of correct answers. The application will randomly select questions to answer incorrectly, based on the defined percentage.

ATS will provide users with a tool that simplifies the process of engaging with Talentely's assessment tests. The application's features will collectively save users time, eliminate repetitive actions, and enable a more focused and controlled testing environment.
