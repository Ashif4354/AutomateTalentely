# If you run any other application while the test is in progress, warnings will come, SO DO AT YOUR OWN RISK
# However warnings have been handled (i.e. the test will continue, but wanings may occur)

# This application only attends tests assigned by training cell
# This applicaiotn does choose correct answers according to the requirements specified by the user
# Some test might not open and throws error, These have been handled too

# All the answers has been taken from Talentely portal only.
# It has been noted that some of the answers in the talentely portal itself is wrong , so these questions will not be answered correctly or skipped. sorry for inconvenience
# Frequency of these wrong answers is less than 1%, So no need to worry

# This application does not have answers to c programming questions 
# So it will not attend c programming tests
# However you can choose to make the application attend the c programming test without the application typing the code
# After opening the application choose option 6 to enable the application to attend c programming tests(without answers)
# How ever in future versions , A solution for this problem may be introduced

# Enter email and password correctly
# If you enter wrong email or password or if you wish to change it, just choose option 3 after opening the aplication and edit your details
# Changing user credentials resets the test progress

# The test progress denotes  the tests completed by the application not the user
# Dont select reset progress option unless you want to reset progress
# The Progress does not reset itself.
# If the progress is reset, all the test will be performed from first by the application

# If you close the application or the browser window at any time, dont worry, the application can continue from the same point (i.e. same test). progress will be saved and will not be reset.
# In any case, if the application closes by itself just run application again

# You can specify how much percentage of questions need to be answered correctly 
# Just select option 4 when you open the application, and enter the percentage
# The number of correctly answered question according to the percentage give by user can vary because Talentely portal is not perfect

# Just select option 5 when you open the application, and enter the percentage
# The time attended for each test may vary by 1 minute, regardless the user mentions percentage or not
# If you are choosing to set time percentage, its best to set a value more than 60%, but its upto you. (The default is 100%)
# The training cell demands minimum 50% test time

# You can manually select which tests to attend
# Just select option 7 after you launch the application
# A browser window will open up listing all the tests assigned by the training cell
# You need to manually select your desired tests
